# Shared session entry

`skills/session-entry/SKILL.md` is the short common orientation for native
Claude/Codex sessions. It separates purpose from runtime and account. It does not
start a loop, select an account, create a conversation or impose Iztac's complete
engineering workflow on other uses.

Deliver it through native user instructions and native skill discovery. Codex's
effective `CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` should tell the agent to read and apply the skill
at session start/resume and task changes. Check for `AGENTS.override.md`, which
takes precedence. Claude's effective user `CLAUDE.md` can import the skill with
`@` so its contents load directly. Keep existing policy intact.

Account-isolated homes need their own instruction/skill projection, using paths
valid inside that environment. Host installation does not prove container
installation. Do not mount a credential-bearing host home just to share skills.
Pi's explicit role loader includes the shared entry file in startup context for
all three roles, before role identity and any bound project instructions. It does
not depend on global skill discovery. Only Iztac receives the engineering skill;
Morty and system-scoped Neo do not inherit repository context from the invoking
directory. The resource-loader checks cover ten role/scope/invocation combinations;
they do not establish authenticated model behavior or production launch.

Native instructions guide the model; they are not a security boundary or proof
that a model followed the skill. Acceptance requires a fresh native session in
each supported environment, showing the loaded context and correct behavior for
personal work, independent project work, assigned engineering work and resume.
Do not claim universal startup enforcement from a frontmatter validator or a
filesystem link check. Existing live sessions may need a fresh session to pick
up instruction changes.
